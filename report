Introduction



Preliminary description and checklist
-   Code will have 5 major parts split into modules
-	Each module will contain code for one function necessary.
-	Modules will be called in a main file where users will have option to choose what they want to use.
-	Modules will be named after each function required for organisation.
o	Numbers – splits numbers and letters
o	Valid – validates numbers
o	Length converts measurements of lengths
o	Case – conversion of upper/lower case
o	Numrem – removes numbers for case transition
o	Main – main file that imports rest of code
-	Main file will print options where users can choose what they want to execute, choice will only execute that module.
-	All results will be printed.

	Code must be cohesive with very little unnecessary code
	If a module is being used the entire module is being used.
	Coupling must be loose
	Code must be easy to read and use
•	Code follows all in checklist
